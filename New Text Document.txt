Procedural Blocks
- Execute concurrently with other assign statements

Initial Block: Executed only once during initialization 
Forever Blocks: Runs forever
LHS should be a register type variable 

Non blocking Assignments <= between a begin and end
order doesn't matter and are frequently used in sequential circuits

Simply, A circuit, a machine or system that has a well defined and finte set of states
FSMs are usually made out of with the combination of 2 or more flip flops
Examples: Ring Counter

Mealy FSM and Moore FSM
